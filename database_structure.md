## Database Structure

### Table: users
This table holds the users of the system and their platform information. It was determined that we don't need (or want) to keep a list of users which represents an individual human, but rather   individual platforms.  This supports the use case of a single person testing with multiple platforms.

Fields:

* userKey (generated by PHP at random upon "registration")
* dateAdded
* dateLastAccess
* browserBrand
* browserVersion
* operatingSystem
* osVersion
* uaString
* atType
* atBrand
* atVersion

### Table: results
This table holds the specific results of testing - in other words whether the test passed or failed and why.

Fields:
* resultID
* userKey (maps to users.userKey)
* dateAdded
* testFileID (maps to testFiles.testFileID)
* result (enum 'Pass', 'Fail')
* comments 

### Table: testFiles
This table holds the details of the files to be tested. It is expected that this information will be automatically generated.

Fields:

* testFileID
* testFilePath
